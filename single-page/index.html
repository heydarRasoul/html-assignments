    <h5>Brush Buying Tips:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Higher-end brushes live longer</li>
      <li>
        Choose the Right Brush Shape:
        <ul>
          <li>Round: Ideal for detail, line work, and controlled strokes</li>
          <li>
            Flat: Great for bold strokes, filling large areas, and blending.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fan: Best for textures, blending, and natural effects like foliage
            or clouds.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Match the Brush to the Medium:
        <ul>
          <li>Oil Painting: Use sturdy, stiff brushes (like hog hair).</li>
          <li>
            Acrylic Painting: Synthetic brushes that hold shape well and
            withstand water.
          </li>
          <li>
            Watercolor Painting: Soft, absorbent brushes (like sable or squirrel
            hair) that hold water and pigment.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
